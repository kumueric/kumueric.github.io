Aloha!

I have taught:
* ICS 111 Intro to Computer Science I (in [Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download))
* ICS 129 Introduction to Databases (Using [MySQL Community Software with MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/))
* ICS 211 Intro to Computer Science II ([continuing the study of data structures and introducing classic algorithms](https://www.edureka.co/blog/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python/))
* BUSA 340 Business Intelligence (introducing students to [data governance](https://www.dataversity.net/what-is-data-governance/) & [visualization](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi-visuals/))
* BUSA 342 Practical Programming: Python ([featuring `pandas`](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/))
* BUSA 348 Data Analytics for Business (featuring [R](https://www.r-project.org/) using [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop))

I strongly encourage all students and faculty to [**_join GitHub Education_**](https://education.github.com/).

I highly recommend that educators use [**_GitHub Classroom_**](https://classroom.github.com/) which allows faculty to [provide feedback to students using the autograder](https://github.blog/2020-03-12-github-teacher-toolbox-and-classroom-with-autograding/).

Also, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides [**AWS Educate** _for students and faculty_](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/).

Google provides [*__Python Online__* via Jupyter Notebooks @ `colab.research.google.com`](https://colab.research.google.com/)
(powered by [Google Cloud Platform, GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)).

[Kaggle provides many examples, challenges, and data sets.](https://www.kaggle.com/)

_Keep learning!_
